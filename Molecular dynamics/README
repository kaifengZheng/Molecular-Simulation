This is a simple discription of the files inside this directory. The project contains two parts, 
studying the properties of Argon melting and calculating the thermal expansion of Argon.
Tnew contains the first part of the work. The T0.3-T3.6 files with the temperature 0.3-3.6 contains 
the data calculated in silico. 

xlcd is the second part of this work. the xlcd files named by diffirent lattice constant such as 1.557. 
There are 5 temperature files inside the xlcd file from 0.3-1.8.

The report file introduces the process how the project work.
